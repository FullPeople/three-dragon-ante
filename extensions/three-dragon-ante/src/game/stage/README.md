# Three.js table stage

Updated 2026-09-12. This is the implemented renderer contract and its bounded test
coverage, not a release, deployment, hardware-performance or multiplayer-UAT claim.
Fronts use the user's supplied card pack; backs retain the original vector dragon.

## Files and contract

- `index.ts`: WebGL scene, finite motion, picking, pending-card reconciliation,
  responsive projection and resource lifecycle.
- `types.ts`: the complete public API; this is the authoritative interface.
- `layout.ts`: seats, physical card locations, anonymous backs and coin display.
- `currency.ts`: supplied gold/silver crops, extruded outlines and owned textures.
- `textures.ts`: lazily loaded supplied card fronts, original vector backs, labels
  and runtime paper, wood and felt materials.
- `../power-effects.ts`: public ability-family to restrained visual-theme lookup;
  it has no rule or privacy authority.
- `stage-selftest.mjs`: actual renderer behavior/pixel checks and three targeted
  mutation modes.

`mountTableStage(canvas, options): StageHandle` consumes `StageModel`, containing
only `PublicView | SeatView | OmniscientView | null`, language, connection/motion flags, selected
 card IDs, public resolution-source IDs, an optional public ability family and target seat, and
 validated public gold-flow endpoints. It does not
receive the host's private GameState, RNG, deck ordering, controller, SDK,
transport, storage or game-command functions. The renderer has no pointer-input
listeners. `onQuality` reports WebGL availability; `onInspect` is a reserved
option, not an installed input callback. The renderer also accepts a local-only
`auto / high / low` quality preference; it is not part of the projection or room
protocol.

The actual handle exposes:

```ts
update(model: StageModel): void;
setQuality(mode: 'auto' | 'high' | 'low'): void;
hitTest(clientX: number, clientY: number): StageHit | null;
getAnchor(query: StageAnchorQuery): StageAnchor | null;
setDrag(value: { cardId: string; x: number; y: number } | null): void;
releaseDrag(options?: { pending?: boolean; zone?: 'ante' | 'flight' }): void;
resolvePending(accepted: boolean): void;
gesture(seatId: string, value: HandGesture | null): void;
suspend(): void;
resume(): void;
destroy(): void;
diagnostics(): StageDiagnostics;
```

Hit testing, drag coordinates and anchors use browser **client CSS pixels**. The
renderer subtracts its canvas rectangle. Callers must not subtract it again or
multiply input by device pixel ratio. `getAnchor` returns `{x,y,visible}` or null;
it does not return a DOMRect. The outer UI adapts that point for onboarding.

Zones are `hand`, `ante`, `flight`, `deck`, `discard`, `stakes`. A drop target must
also match the acting seat: the central public ante area is not the player's own
face-down slot. ResizeObserver belongs to the renderer; there is no public
`resize()` or historical `play(cues)` method.

## Appearance and visible information

The table, card thickness, both card sides and coins are actual WebGL meshes.
The table is rotationally symmetric with a bevelled timber edge, padded rail,
apron and pedestal. Regions rotate in the same direction as their cards. Flight
regions are wider and carry labels on the felt. Overlapping cards expose the top
strength corner, which is also their inspection anchor.

Fronts use the 100 approved WebP scans with their portrait proportions and unlit
materials to preserve their printed colors. Backs use the original single-dragon
Canvas paths, not the supplied pack's reverse. Paper, wood grain and felt are
generated locally by code. The two coin faces are conventionally cropped from the
user's reference and mapped to extruded outlines. No AI images are used. Textures request one
frame after loading, cancel late callbacks on disposal, and do not create an idle
render loop. CanvasTexture remains the GPU texture format.

A directional shadow and warm fill illuminate the table. The renderer still
accepts a local `auto / high / low` profile, but the table no longer exposes a
user-facing quality switch: `ui.ts` passes `auto` and `auto` reserves the bounded
profile for genuinely constrained surfaces only. It selects `low` on a
coarse-pointer device, or when the window's short side is at most 480 px; a
mouse-driven window of ordinary size is never silently reduced, and a modest
memory hint is no longer a reason to drop the shadow pass. `high` caps DPR at
1.75 and `low` caps it at 1.15. Low quality disables shadow maps, reduces
representative deck/coin layers and smoke puffs, but keeps card faces, exact
labels, ready-power glyphs, resolution lines and finite key effects. The selected
mode never enters GameState, a projection or a room message. There is no
post-processing chain, orbit loop or continuously changing material. The local
mesh hand keeps a useful foreground size on portrait
displays. `getAnchor` points to a hand card's exposed strength corner, which
remains a raycast target even where physical cards overlap. Small public cards use
the caller's inspection and accessible-list UI for detail.

The central 3D turn compass was **removed** on 2026-09-14: it read as a stray
control floating over the felt, so the acting seat no longer has a mesh marker on
the table. The renderer still derives the acting seat from the public projection
alone, and the DOM clockwise turn hint stays the authoritative, accessible cue for
whose turn it is. Nothing about the compass remains in `StageDiagnostics`.

Only visible physical locations create fronts: the current private hand, public
flights, public antes and the discard top. Committed antes remain face down in
a normal `SeatView`; the explicitly host-local `OmniscientView` may also create
fronts for every locally authorized hand and committed ante. The omniscient
branch is presentation-only and is never accepted by a wire packer. Opponents
use anonymous indexed backs in all ordinary player and spectator views, never hidden card IDs. The informational
`revealed` list does not duplicate physical cards. Changing a private seat to a
spectator cancels private pending visuals immediately. The repayment pool `hole`
is shown accurately by the outer DOM summary, not a separate current stage mesh.

The hand's engine-authored `power-ready` hint uses a restrained brass card halo
plus one small family glyph on the WebGL card; an engine-authored
`playable-no-power` hint uses a quieter blue-gray edge so the WebGL hand and DOM
fallback distinguish “can play” from “will trigger” in the same way. In a normal
`SeatView` the hint is local to the owner seat; in the explicitly host-local
`OmniscientView` the same hint may decorate each locally revealed hand. It is
never a public effect cue.
An active public resolution source uses a separate focus, one 760 ms ring pulse
and one finite three-dragon formation burst: an ember triangle, tide rings, grove
leaves, arcane diamond or crown pentagon plus six soft smoke puffs that expand
and rise for 980 ms. The public ability
family selects a restrained ember, tide, grove, arcane or crown palette and a
slightly different rotation cadence. A public target seat receives a matching
flight-zone accent and a curved source-to-target line. The public relation can
be `direct`, `choice`, `payment`, `transfer` or `swap`; the line uses a
different finite bend/weight for those meanings, and its target endpoint gets a
small relation-shaped marker (round, square, round, triangle or hexagon). The
DOM power text uses the matching localized label. These cues are
presentation-only: they do not make a card legal, and a private hand ID is never
eligible for the public resolution line, pulse or burst. The pulses and burst are
one-shot per resolution-source/theme change, so an open choice does not create an
idle particle loop. They are cancelled on reconnect, revision gaps,
hidden/suspended surfaces, context loss, reduced motion and destruction.

Public `goldFlows` create at most sixteen transient coin meshes per projection,
with up to four representative coins per validated transfer. A path is directional:
`stakes` is the central source/target, `hole` is the separate public debt pool,
and seat IDs resolve to that seat's ante pile. The same flow key is consumed once
even when a power explanation causes the stage to repaint; front-end net-difference
animation is skipped for that projection to prevent duplicate coins. Ante payment
remains owned by the staged reveal timeline. Debt repayment and end-of-game hole
distribution use explicit `PAID_HOLE` / `TOOK_HOLE` events; zero-value debt clears
remain readable but produce no coin mesh. Invalid or unknown endpoints are ignored,
and no private card or intermediate task is needed to draw a path.

Audio is a separate local presentation channel. A public power cue may emit
one finite family sound (`power-ember`, `power-tide`, `power-grove`,
`power-arcane` or `power-crown`) when its explanation becomes current. The
audio pool keeps the existing user-unlock, owner arbitration, recent-key and
voice limits; unavailable or blocked audio never delays a rules action. Hand
`power-ready` hints stay silent, and reconnects, historical snapshots, hidden
documents and cleared presentations never replay a missed power sound.

## Submission is not acceptance

Dragging and `releaseDrag({pending:true, zone})` never mean host acceptance. There
is one mesh per card ID, retained while a projection can arrive before its receipt.
The outer integration calls `resolvePending` only after matching the exact action,
table and game receipt against an applied authoritative projection. Both acceptance
and rejection reconcile to the current authoritative location; rejection never
invents a hand card absent from the current projection.

The integrated UI requires `TableView.actionReceiptVersion === 1`. An older live
background without this marker cannot submit game commands through the new UI;
the page explains the refresh requirement while preserving viewing and exit.
`pending=false`, a resolved send Promise and another player's revision change are
not fallback success signals. Controller-generated success receipts follow valid
host snapshots; local rejection receipts are identified separately. The tutorial
uses its actual isolated engine result, not a timer, to produce the same outcome
contract.

Timeout or failed LOCAL delivery preserves the immutable original action for
retry. A retry cannot change its action ID, contents or submitted revision. The
renderer itself knows none of that transport and must not send a retry.

New games, changed seats, explicit reconnect snapshots and disconnection clear
old drag state. `animate:false` requests direct placement. Revision gaps do not
replay old transitions. The renderer still does not replay the public history
list: finite movements come only from successive projections. The table UI owns
the complete public timeline drawer and its local event replay; that replay is a
reading aid and does not reconstruct private choices, deck order or intermediate
network states. Current motion is a bounded 470 ms pose interpolation with a
raised arc, finite flip and landing, not the older proposed CubicBezier cue API.
It cannot reconstruct every intermediate ability effect from a final projection.

## Decorative silver convention

Rules still use integer gold, debt, stakes and repayment values. Ten decorative
silver pieces represent **one gold**. `coinDenominations(n)` decomposes a positive
integer into `n-1` gold and ten silver pieces; zero has no coins. This replaces the
initial unimplemented silver-1/gold-5 proposal. There is no silver rules account,
fractional bet, currency-exchange action or draggable wagering interface.

Visible piles are bounded representative stacks: at most 24 gold meshes and ten
silver meshes per pile, plus the exact integer-gold label. Explicit public transfer
animation uses at most sixteen transient meshes per projection; the older net
deficit/gain pairing remains a fallback for state changes without a public transfer
record. Neither path claims to reconstruct unseen intermediate transfers or infer
a hidden card.

## Lifecycle and test boundary

Rendering is requested on change and while finite movements run. There is no idle
RAF or continuous light loop. Hidden/suspended surfaces stop rendering. Resize
recalculates projection; context loss reports unavailability to the DOM fallback,
and restoration reuses the canvas. Destroy releases materials, textures,
geometries, instance resources and the WebGL context. A late callback cannot
restart a destroyed surface. Reduced motion places cards without the finite arc.

The recorded stage baseline is **78 behavior/pixel checks** in installed Chrome,
using actual Three.js WebGL through ANGLE SwiftShader. It uses the real rules
engine for the ante test; later display cases are explicit projection fixtures.
Visibility uses an explicit DOM lifecycle signal. The baseline covers actual
geometry/pixels, picking, pending/projection ordering, privacy, motion settling,
coin representation, gestures, reduced motion, revision gaps, pause/resume,
portrait foreground, language texture disposal, spectator changes, context loss,
private ready-hand halo/family glyph pixels in wide and portrait views, explicit public gold paths, host-only omniscient hand/ante faces, host-only omniscient opponent ready-hand glyphs with immediate privacy restoration, and final cleanup. The vector-only final source must
receive its own fresh run;
a previous bitmap-request assertion cannot certify the final art choice.

Each mutation requires a unique source anchor, successful compilation and its
named runtime assertion. Build errors and unrelated failures do not count as
kills. Motion completion waits for the finite animation state, bounded at ten
seconds for software rendering. Each runner prints a fresh evidence directory
and writes source hashes; use those records for exact runs rather than treating
this documentation update as a test execution.

The stage's explicit `resolvePending` calls test renderer behavior only. Real
controller receipt handling has separate tests in
`tools/three-dragon-action-receipt-selftest.mjs`; pointer lifecycle has
`tools/three-dragon-drag-selftest.mjs`. UI, onboarding and LE rules have their own
suites and counts. Do not combine them into a stage-only number.

This evidence is not native Owlbear integration, hardware frame-time measurement,
final two/six-seat screen acceptance, or multi-client UAT. The final integration
still needs real pointer/keyboard/touch interaction, correct lift/flip/flat landing,
private-choice handling, old-background refusal, authoritative ACK/retry ordering,
window recreation, fallback and device-performance checks. No deployment or
version promise follows from these renderer tests.

Deck and discard tops sit on bounded physical paper-edge stacks. Only public counts determine height; two instanced meshes hold at most sixteen representative layers. A single card rests on the felt. The existing owned-instance cleanup also disposes those stacks.

Each seat has a single aligned region pair: ante immediately left of flight, at the same radial depth. Coins sit directly on top of that seat's ante card, with small stable offsets and no extra tray. The far card corners stay exposed; coins do not intercept card inspection. Deck and discard always face the screen, and settled coin faces stay upright. Two-to-six-seat tests populate both flights and antes.
