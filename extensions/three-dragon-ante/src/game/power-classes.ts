/**
 * The rule *semantics* of an ability, as opposed to the card family that owns
 * it. Families alone are a poor key for presentation: `green` and `copper` are
 * different colours but different kinds of power, while `black` and `thief` are
 * different families that both take gold out of the stakes. Grouping the 40
 * families by what the ability actually does lets each kind of effect get one
 * deliberate treatment instead of forty ad-hoc ones.
 *
 * This is a presentation lookup only. It has no rule authority, never receives
 * a private card, and never changes what is legal.
